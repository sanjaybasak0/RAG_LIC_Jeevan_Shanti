No policy of life insurance shall be called in question on any ground whatsoever after the expiry \\nof three years from the date of the policy, i.e. from the date of issuance of the policy or the date \\nof commencement of risk or the date of revival of the policy or the date of the rider to the policy, \\nwhichever is later.  \\n \\n2.

Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (2), no insurer shall repudiate a life insurance \\npolicy on the ground of fraud if the insured can prove that the misstatement of or suppression of \\na material fact was true to the best of his knowledge and belief or that there was no deliberate \\nintention to suppress the fact or that such misstatement of or suppression of a material fact are \\nwithin the knowledge of the insurer: \\n \\nProvided that in case of fraud, the onus of disproving lies upon the beneficiaries, in case the \\npolicyholder is not alive. \\n \\nExplanation – A person who solicits and negotiates a contract of insurance shall be deemed for \\nthe purpose of the formation of the contract, to be the agent of the insurer. \\n \\n4. A policy of life insurance may be called in question at any time within three years from the date of \\nissuance of the policy or the date of commencement of risk or the date of revival of the policy or \\nthe date of the rider to the policy, whichever is later, on the ground that any statement of or \\nsuppression of a fact material to the expectancy of the life of the insured was incorrectly made in \\nthe proposal or other document on the basis of which the policy was issued or revived or rider \\nissued:  \\n \\nProvided that the insurer shall have to communicate in writing to the insured or the legal \\nrepresentatives or nominees or assignees of the insured the grounds and materials on which \\nsuch decision to repudiate the policy of life insurance is based:  \\n \\nProvided further that in case of repudiation of the policy on the ground of misstatement or \\nsuppression of a material fact, and not on the ground of fraud the premiums collected on the \\npolicy till the date of repudiation shall be paid to the insured or the legal representatives or \\nnominees or assignees of the insured within a period of ninety days from the date of such \\nrepudiation.

No policy of life insurance shall be called in question on any ground whatsoever after the expiry \nof three years from the date of the policy, i.e. from the date of issuance of the policy or the date \nof commencement of risk or the date of revival of the policy or the date of the rider to the policy, \nwhichever is later.  \n \n2. A policy of life insurance may be called in question at any time within three years from the date of \nissuance of the policy or the date of commencement of risk or the date of revival of the policy or \nthe date of the rider to the policy, whichever is later on the ground of fraud:  \n \nProvided that the insurer shall have to communicate in writing to the insured or the legal \nrepresentatives or nominees or assignees of the insured the grounds and materials on which \nsuch decision is based. \n \nExplanation I.-For the purposes of this sub-section, the expression “fraud” means any of the \nfollowing acts committed by the insured or by his agent, with the intent to deceive the insurer or \nto induce the insurer to issue a life insurance policy:-  \na) the suggestion, as a fact of that which is not true and which the insured does not believe \nto be true;  \nb) the active concealment of a fact by the insured having knowledge or belief of the fact;  \nc) any other act fitted to deceive; and  \nd) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent. \n \nExplanation II- Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the assessment of the risk by the insurer is \nnot fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that regard being had to them, it is the \nduty of the insured or his agent, keeping silence to speak, or unless his silence is, in itself, \nequivalent to speak. \n \n3.
